# C-Shell
A simple shell implementation written in C:
by Nathan Sherburne, Fall 2016.

I wrote this shell in CS570 Fall 2016 at San Diego State University.
I wrote p2.c and getword.c. The .h files and the makefile were provided in the course (CS570).

It is not nearly a full-blown shell, but it can handle multiple pipes, input and output redirect, process backgrounding, environment variables, and the change directory(chdir()) builtin.
